  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work

exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

However, there is one case where the user must become a licensee.
You must become a licensee if you copy this entire project or some parts of
it without giving credit to the original authors (plagiarism: copying a project
and claiming it was made by you when in fact it wasn't). 
In the case of plagiarism, we will understand that you are acting on bad faith
and against us and the open-source philosofy, and therefore you must follow 
this license instead of the [MIT LICENSE.](https://github.com/pablogalve/TurboX-Engine/blob/master/MIT_LICENSE)

4. Using this license without paying the fees

but hasn't bought it, the said user will be contacted by the licensor
to give them the option to either buy the license or stop acting with
the terms provided in (1) to be regulated by MIT License instead of this
one. If the user does not answer or refuses to follow the instructions in
a reasonable period of time of 2 weeks, counting from the time of 
notification, then the user will be considered to commit plagiarism,
act on bad faith and against us and the open-source philosophy. 
The user will be liable to the licensor by 200 EUR for damages.

5. Breach of contract

8. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
